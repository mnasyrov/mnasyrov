### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lead software engineer and have extensive experience in web development: from backend servers to frontend applications. And I like to develop new products and create open-source tools.

My main languages are JavaScript and TypeScript at the moment. Previously I coded in Java, C# and Python a lot.
